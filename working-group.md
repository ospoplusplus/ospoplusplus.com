The center of OSPO++ is our working groups - recurring meetings where we share how we're building open source program offices (OSPOs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other's efforts.

Over the past two years, we've held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of OSPOs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.

We have four different major working groups, focusing on:

- Universities and higher education institutions
- Cities and governments
- US Open Source policy
- The European Open Source network

We post about how to join on our mailing list.

### When:

- The US Open Source Policy group has a different schedule; [learn more here](/policyroundtable).

- The EU OSS network meets quarterly, in person, at a different European host city. Get in touch to learn more.

- 'Universities and Academia' and 'Cities and Governments' each generally meet once monthly on Thursdays.

### Where:

Zoom. While we'd like to use an open source platform, we find that this works best for the our needs.

### Rules:

We follow both [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) and the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

### Who:

Anyone who currently runs an OSPO, inside champions looking to build an OSPO in their organization, and anyone else seeking to be part of this conversation.

### How?
