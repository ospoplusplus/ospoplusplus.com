The center of OSPO++ is our working group - a biweekly, recurring meeting where we share how we're building open source program offices (OSPOs), where we collaborate on new initiatives, where we form a community of like-minded open source practitioners, and where we support each other's efforts.


Over the past two years, we've held more than 500 hours of collective mind-sharing on the topic of OSPOs and how to effectively bring open source to our institutions.

### December 9 - 'Universities and Academia' and 'Cities and Governments'
  - Topic:  2021 FOSS OSPO Community Closing Happy Hours
  - Description:   As 2021 roles to a close, we invite all those in the OSPO ecosystem, that we have interacted with virtually, in-person or have yet to meet, to come together, stop by and share in the group discussion, announce & celebrate your and other's FOSS wins together, have a breakout chat with a friend, and join us for a drink.
